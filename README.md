# Devlog Information
This development log was created by NovaTheMighty on 12/26/2018 at 3:00 PM EST. This devlog has been created to document all work on "Every JRPG Ever", henceforth referred to as "EJRPGE". 

# Game Information
EJRPGE is an indie Japanese Role-Playing Game, or JRPG, developed by Erik "NovaTheMighty" Jacob. The game was started in late November / early December of 2018, with a projected release date of sometime in 2019. The game centers around 4 "heroes of light" on a typical JRPG quest to save the world by restoring light to the four elemental crystals. A primary point of this game is the idea of parodying and playing off of the tropes in late 1980s / early 1990s JRPGS, like "Final Fantasy" on the NES. Such tropes include protecting four elemental crystals / orbs / whatever, obvious bad guys, obvious betrayals, overly complicated plot, etc. Another major point of this game is that it will last anwhere from 1 to 3 hours, further divided into 3 parts, and then, several chapters. The idea is that someone on the go can play the game for a brief period of time, but make a lot of progress in that brief period. EJRPGE is being developed using RPG Maker XP. As of 12/26/18, a demo had been released, containing a slightly modified prologue and chapter 1. The rest of the game will be released by chapter, and it will cost $5.99 on NTM Studios' GameJolt Storefront.

# FAQs
- Is there a demo?
  - Yes. As mentioned above, there is a free demo containing a slightly modified prologue and chapter one on our GameJolt Storefront at https://gamejolt.com/games/thatjrpg/383511.
- Will the game's code be uploaded to GitHub?
  - No. Because I plan on selling the game, I will NOT be posting the game's code to this page, or any other. 
- What is modified in the demo?
  - A few text changes will be present in the final version of the prologue and chapter 1. It is a negligible change.
- Why change it, then?
  - It's the way that sentence is worded. I want to change it in the final product, but I see no need to fix it in the demo, since it is just an incomplete version of the full game.
- You said the game will cost $5.99? Is this price per chapter, or for the whole game?
  - The $5.99 price tag is for the whole game. Considering each chapter might be 10 minutes at most, you'd end up paying $77.87 for a 3 hour game if that was the price tag per chapter.
- Will each chapter be available as it is completed?
  - Yes. As I complete each chapter, it will be added to the game. If you buy the game for $5.99 when chapter 2 has been released, then you don't have to pay for it again when the final chapter is released. Think of it as buying an early access game. You can buy the game before it is complete, but you don't have to pay for it again when it's complete.
- How much of the game is complete? The story? The art? The music?
  - The first thing I planned is the story. It is complete
  - We're working on the actual game now.
  - The OST is also being composed as of 12/26/18
  - After the final chapter is released, we will focus on specific artwork.

# Known Bugs
- There are certain areas where talking to an NPC with a specific move route on a specific tile will softlock the game. Known NPCs affected include the waitress in the Seaside Town Tavern. As of 12/26/18, the bug has not been resolved, and there are no plans to fix it until later on in development, as triggering it can be prevented. 

# Major Updates
- As of 12/20/18, the demo has been completed. It contains a slightly modified prologue and chapter 1. It can be downloaded for free at https://gamejolt.com/games/thatjrpg/383511.
